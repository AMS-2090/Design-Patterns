# Design Pattern: Factory

## Abstract Factory

> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Factory Method

> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
> Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
